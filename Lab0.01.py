# Lab 0.01 #
############

In this lab we will create a class that will represent colors 
and build a function to combine two colors.


1.  Create a class, Color.
2.  Instantiate at least 3 colors.
3.  Add attributes of r, g, and b to those instances.
4.  Create a function, add_color, which takes in two colors 
    and returns a color that is the sum of the two reds, greens, 
    and blues. Don't forget: the maximum value for R, G, or B is 255.
