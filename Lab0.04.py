Overview
--------
Given the following Sample Code, practice using inheritance 
to create specific child classes for different types of Pokemon.

Create the three child classes below:
1. Water Type
When attacking a fire type, the attack is more effective

When attacking a grass type the effect is less effective

When growl is called print out Splish Splash

2. Fire Type
When attacking a water type, the attack is less effective

When attacking a grass type the effect is more effective

When growl is called print out "Fire Fire"

3. Grass Type
When attacking a water type, the attack is more effective

When attacking a fire type the effect is less effective

When growl is called print out "Cheep Cheep"

##############################################################
# Note: In order to check what type an object is you can use #
# isinstance which takes in an object, a class and returns a #
# Boolean if the object is the type of the inputted class.   #

Example Code
------------
my_pet = Pet()
isinstance(my_pet, Pet) # returns true
isinstance(my_pet, Dog) # returns false
